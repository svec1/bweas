When adding a new function, it must be borne in mind that it must comply with the general theory of assembly systems. Make sure that your idea fits into these principles. If your proposed feature is a new called function and does not correspond to the specified theory, as well as makes minimal changes to the system, such a request will not be accepted. In this case, the function can be considered as an idea for creating a custom module. Please note that in the future such a feature may be integrated into a standard BWEAS module if it meets the requirements and receives community approval.

Please provide a detailed description of your idea, including its advantages and possible applications within the framework of the assembly system.
